# Executive Decision Memo: Data-Driven Go / No-Go

## Executive Summary (Decision at a Glance)
**Recommendation:** **GO (with guardrails)**

Based on synthesized evidence from pricing elasticity analysis, causal impact evaluation, experimentation readouts, and demand forecasting under uncertainty, the expected upside of proceeding outweighs the downside risk under baseline assumptions. However, material uncertainty remains, warranting phased execution and predefined stop-loss thresholds.

This memo demonstrates how a Senior Economist translates multiple analytical inputs into a single, actionable executive decision.

## Decision Context
The business faces a strategic choice on whether to proceed with a proposed initiative under uncertainty. Individual analyses provide partial insights, but leadership requires an integrated recommendation that accounts for causal effects, demand response, experimental evidence, and forward-looking risk.

The objective is not to maximize precision in any single model, but to support a **robust decision** under imperfect information.

## Evidence Synthesized

### 1. Pricing & Demand Response
- Estimated price elasticity indicates demand sensitivity within a range consistent with profitable expansion under moderate price or feature changes.
- Revenue simulations suggest positive expected value under baseline demand assumptions, with downside exposure under adverse scenarios.

### 2. Causal Impact Evaluation
- Difference-in-Differences and event-study analyses indicate a statistically meaningful treatment effect following rollout, with no evidence of strong pre-trend violations.
- Results are directionally stable across reasonable robustness checks.

### 3. Experimentation & Statistical Power
- Experimental readouts show effect sizes near the minimum detectable effect (MDE), implying meaningful but not oversized gains.
- Power analysis highlights the risk of false negatives if scaled prematurely without sufficient exposure.

### 4. Forecasting & Uncertainty
- Demand forecasts with prediction intervals show upside potential but wide uncertainty bands.
- Downside scenarios remain plausible, particularly under slower adoption or adverse external conditions.

## Integrated Risk Assessment
- **Upside risk:** Moderate and supported by multiple signals.
- **Downside risk:** Non-trivial, primarily driven by demand uncertainty rather than negative causal effects.
- **Key uncertainty drivers:** Adoption speed, demand volatility, and scalability constraints.

No single analysis is decisive in isolation; confidence emerges from **directional alignment across methods**.

---

## Recommendation Rationale
Proceeding is justified because:
- Expected value is positive under baseline assumptions.
- Causal and experimental evidence do not indicate harm.
- Risks are primarily related to uncertainty, not structural flaws.

However, unconditional scaling would be inappropriate given forecast dispersion.

---

## Guardrails & Next Steps
If proceeding, the following guardrails are recommended:
1. **Phased rollout** with predefined checkpoints.
2. **Stop-loss thresholds** tied to demand and revenue metrics.
3. **Incremental experimentation** to tighten uncertainty bands.
4. **Continuous monitoring** of leading indicators identified in forecasting analysis.

A No-Go decision should be triggered if early signals fall below agreed thresholds.

## What This Demonstrates
This project illustrates the core value-add of a Senior Economist:
- Synthesizing diverse analyses into a single recommendation
- Communicating uncertainty and trade-offs clearly
- Prioritizing decision quality over model complexity
- Speaking the language of senior leadership

This is the distinction between producing analyses and **owning decisions**.
